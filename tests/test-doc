Test programs are provided for the matprod and piped-matprod routines,
in the directory "tests", which share a common framework, and which
can also be used to test matrix multiply routines in a BLAS or other
library.  These test programs can perform checks on correctness, but
are mainly meant for testing speed.  If ALIGN and/or ALIGN_OFFSET is
defined, the test program will allocate matrices with the specfied
alignment.


Running the programs.

These programs are invoked by a command such as the following:

    matprod-test rep A B C D

Where the arguments are either positive integers (or "v" or "V", as
discussed below), or "t" or "T".  In this example, three matrices of
dimensions AxB, BxC, and CxD are created, and the product of the first
of these matrices with the product of the second and third matrices is
computed (note the right associativity), with this computation
repeated rep times (with identical results each time, one hopes).  The
first, second, second-to-last, and last elements of the result are
then printed on standard output, except that fewer elements are
printed when only fewer exist.  If the environment variable PRINTWHOLE
is defined (as anything), the entire result matrix is also printed.

If an argument after "rep" is "t" or "T", the matrix whose dimensions
follow is stored in transposed form, and the trans1, trans2, or
trans12 form of the multiply routine is called (or a call with
analogous options is done for BLAS tests).

In general, n>2 arguments (other than "t" or "T") follow the rep
argument, defining the dimensions of n-1 matrices, which are used as
operands in n-2 matrix multiplication operations, which associate to
the right.  The result of each of these products will be a matrix with
number of rows equal to the first argument and number of columns equal
to the last argument.

The "T" argument can be used only for one of the last two matrices,
and results in the two last matrices being identical (sharing the same
memory).  This is possible only if the number of rows of the first is
the same as the number of columns of the second.  The result of the
multiply will be symmetric, and hence may perhaps be computed faster.

An argument after rep with the value "1" may be replaced with the
argument "v" or "V", which has the same effect as "1", except that the
appropriate scalar_vec, vec_vec, vec_mat, mat_vec, or outer procedure
is used for some or all products, rather than the general matrix
multiplication procedure.  This applies both to the vectors specified
in this way, and the vectors that result from multiplying such a
vector by a matrix.  For example, if the last argument is "v", all the
products will use the mat_vec procedure, except if the first operand
was also specified using "v" or "V", in which case the vec_vec
procedure will be used.  The scalar_vec procedure is used when both
dimensions of the left operand are specified with "v".

The matrices created by the test programs have elements that are set
to 0.1 times the sum of the number of rows and columns in the matrix,
plus 0.01 times the product of the number of rows and columns in the
matrix, plus 0.01 times the product of the row and column indexes for
each element.  A matrix whose transpose will be used as an operand
will be initialized so that this is its value after transposition, so
the results obtained should be the same with or without the "t"
option, on either the left or right.  Since the initialization is
invariant to transposition, the result with "T" instead of "t" is also

If the last argument to piped-matprod-test (see below) is "V" (only,
not "v"), the final matrix (a column vector) will be supplied as
pipelined output from a task procedure that delivers elements in
groups of 17 (or fewer for the last group), with variable time lags.
This allows pipelining to be tested for the mat_vec and vec_vec
procedures, for which pipelined input cannot otherwise be arranged.
(Of course, this is slower than just accessing the already-initialized
matrix.)
the same.

If the environment variable CHECK is defined (as anything), the
results are checked against simple code implementing the naive
algorithm, resulting in either "Check OK" being printed, or an error
message followed by an abort.  Note that these checks take time, and
so should not be done when running the test programs for performance
evaluation.


Makefile for compiling program versions.

Several test programs can be compiled using the supplied Makefile,
including the following (some other versions are also compiled, see
make-common for details):

    matprod-test

      Uses the procedures in matprod.c.  A number of other versions of
      this test program are also compiled, with varying alignment
      options, etc.  See the Makefile for details.

    piped-matprod-test

      Uses the procedures in piped-matprod.c, and the helpers library.
      The number of helper threads used is given by the environment
      variable HELPERS (default 0).  The amount of splitting to do is
      given by the environment variable SPLIT (default 1).  If SPLIT
      is 0, and the environment variable MIN exists and is not 0, the
      split will be set to HELPERS plus 1 if the number of multiplies
      is at least MIN; otherwise 0 for SPLIT results in the operation
      being done directly in the master thread.  Pipelining will be
      done if possible unless the environment variable NOPIPE is
      defined (as anything).

      See below for the special role of a last argument of "V".

      If an environment variable TRACE is defined, trace output from
      the helpers library is enabled.  

    blas0-test

      Uses BLAS routines in the following FORTRAN source files:

          ddot.f  dgemv.f  dgemm.f  dsyrk.f  lsame.f

      A xerbla routine for BLAS error reporting is provided as part of 
      the test program.  The dsyrk routine is used when the "T" option 
      is specified, along with a C routine for filling in the lower 
      triangle of the matrix from the upper triangle.  

      The versions of these files distributed here were downloaded on
      2018-02-24 from www.netlib.org/blas (BLAS-3.8.0).  They are
      known as the "reference BLAS" routines.

    blas1-test

      Like blas-test, except that all BLAS routines are taken from one
      file called blas1.f.  The version of blas1.f distributed is the
      one used in R-2.15.0, which is a modifed version of those in the
      reference BLAS.

    blas2-test

      Like blas-test, except that all BLAS routines are taken from one
      file called blas2.f.  The vesion of blas2.f distributed is the
      modified version of the one from R-2.15.0 that is used in pqR.

    blas3-test

      Like blas-test, except that BLAS routines are taken from the
      Linux library /usr/lib/libblas.so.3, which can be set to various
      BLAS implementations (eg, by using "update-alternatives").  The
      location of this library may be different on some Linux systems.

    blas4-test

      Like blas-test, except that BLAS routines are taken from the Mac
      "Accelerate" framework (also known as "VecLib").

The blas test programs are not compiled by default, but are compiled
by "make blas-linux" (builds blas3-test) or "make blas-mac" (builds
blas4-test).

The helpers procedures that are used in the piped-matprod test
programs can be obtained from github.com/radfordneal/helpers.
Versions of the required helpers.c and helpers.h files are included in
the tests directory here, but the helpers repository should be
consulted for documentation, and to check for the most recent version.


Facilities for running programs and looking at the results.

The shell file run-tests runs a series of tests, with the test program
specified by its first argument (eg, "matprod", for matprod-test).
For more details on the testing framework, look at the Makefile and
shell files in the tests directory, and the subdirectories in it that
record results on various systems used for testing.

The output is normally stored in a file with extension .out, with just
the times extracted into a .tim file.  Ratios of times from two .tim
files can be compared with cmp-tim, or plotted with plt-tim (using
xgraph).

The plt-mat-tim shell file plots times for the analogous tests done
using the mat_mat, trans1, trans2, and trans12 procedures.
