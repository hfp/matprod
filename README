The matprod library contains procedures for vector-vector,
matrix-vector, vector-matrix, and matrix-matrix multiplication.  The
file matprod.c (interface defined in matprod.h) contains conventional
versions of these procedures.  The file piped-matprod.c (interface
defined in piped-matprod.h) contains versions that are structured as
task procedures for use with the "helpers" library for parallel
execution of tasks, with pipelining.

See matprod-doc and comments in the source files for further
documentation.

This software is available at github.com/radfordneal/matprod.  The
helpers library is available from github.com/radfordneal/helpers.
