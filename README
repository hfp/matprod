The matprod library contains procedures for doing scalar-vector,
vector-vector, matrix-vector, vector-matrix, vector outer product, and
matrix-matrix multiplication, plus version of matrix-matrix
multiplication where one or both operands are transposed.  These
procedures are written to produce exactly the same result as the naive
procedures that sum products sequentially.  Subject to this
restriction, they are written to be reasonably fast, and can take
advantage of SIMD instructions on Intel/AMD processors.

The file matprod.c (interface defined in matprod.h) contains direct
versions of these procedures.  The file piped-matprod.c (interface
defined in piped-matprod.h) contains versions that are structured as
task procedures for use with the "helpers" library for parallel
execution of tasks, with pipelining.

The application interface to these procedures is documented in api-doc.
Some notes on the implementation are in imp-doc.

The directory "tests" contains some test programs, documented in
test-doc.

This software is available at github.com/radfordneal/matprod.  The
helpers library is available from github.com/radfordneal/helpers.

See VERSIONS for a list of stable versions of the software.
