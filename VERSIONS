Stable versions of the matprod software, given by their commit ID at
github.com/radfordneal/matprod:

d817c2ca3e28d07fff81669a97d4144eb1a89edd

    Not really stable, but seems to work, and completely implements
    the revised scheme and API, including parallelization, so suitable
    for trying out in pqR.  Needs some more code cleanup, performance
    improvements, and testing.
